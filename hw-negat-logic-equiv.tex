\begin{enumerate}
  % Come up with a bunch of specific examples; "necessitate".
    \item Write out the truth table for ``If not Q then not P''.

    \item Prove part (b) of DeMorgan's Laws in two different ways: with a proof written in paragraph form, and with a truth table.

  %   \item 
  % \begin{enumerate}
  %     \item Prove Theorem~\ref{thm:negation-conditional} in two ways: with a paragraph, and with a truth table.
  %     \item Find an example for P and Q that makes both ``Not `if P then Q'~''\sidenote{This looks clunky; if you prefer, ``The statement `If P then Q' is false'' means the same thing.} and ``Not P and Q'' true.
  %     \item Find an example for P and Q that makes both statements false.
  % \end{enumerate}

    \item The statement ``If P then Q'' is equivalent to a statement of the form ``\underline{\hspace{.5in}} or \underline{\hspace{.5in}}''.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Fill in the blanks, and prove your answer with either a proof in paragraph form or a truth table.
      \item Give an example of P and Q so that both statements are true, and write down the corresponding statements.
      \item Now give an example where both statements are false.
  \end{enumerate}

    \item Prove that ``If P, then Q or R'' is equivalent to ``If P and not Q, then R'' without using a truth table.
