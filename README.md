On Writing Proofs
=================

This is the beginning of my (idiosyncratic) text for an introduction to proofs class. As is, chapters are intended as drop-in replacements for Richard Hammack's excellent [Book of Proof](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof). I may at some point expand this to a stand-alone text.

Compiling
---------

Run pdflatex. Required packages can be found in the preamble of Proofs.tex, the main tex file. These can be found in the TeXLive-2009 package. Some packages (notably tufte-book) require newer versions than can be found in TeXLive-2009; these are included.
