    \item Consider the conditional ``If P then Q'' and its converse. In the following, you are asked to come up with an example P and Q which satisfies certain conditions. That means that you should choose a specific statement for P (like ``clowns are scary''\sidenote{True fact.}) and a specific statement for Q in such a way that the condition is satisfied.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Come up with an example of P and Q which makes both statements (i.e.~the conditional and its converse) true; write down both statements.
      \item Same question, but now both statements should be false.
      \item Same question, but now ``If P then Q'' is true and the converse is false.
      \item Same question, but now ``If P then Q'' is false and the converse is true.
  \end{enumerate}
