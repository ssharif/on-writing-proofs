\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make a truth table for ``If P and Q, then R.''
    \item Come up with an example for each line of the truth table of ``If P and Q, then R.'' That is, come up with an example where all of P, Q, and R are true; another where P and Q are true, but R is false; and so forth.
    \item Make a truth table for ``If P, then Q or R.''
