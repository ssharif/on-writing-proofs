\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is $\R^2 \subset \R^3$?

    \item True or false: if $A \subset B$, then $\sP(A) \subset \sP(B)$.\sidenote{You should of course prove your answer. If false, it's enough to come up with a single example.}

    \item Prove that $A = B$ if and only if $\sP(A) = \sP(B)$.

    \item Let $S = [0,6] \times [0,2]$. A powerful eccentric alien orders every adult on the planet to choose an element of $\sP(S)$. If any two people choose the same element, the planet will be vaporized. Otherwise, we each get a bag of cherries. What element would you choose? Is there some easy instruction that you could give humanity to guarantee survival?
