\begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. Prove that $A \cap B \subset A \cup B$.

  \item Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are sets, and that $A \cap B = A \cup B$. What can you conclude?\sidenote{If you're thinking, ``How the heck should I know?'', then I highly recommend doing out several examples. That is, choose different pairs of sets $A$ and $B$, and test to see if the equality $A \cap B = A \cup B$ holds or not. Then try to see if there is a pattern to the cases where equality does hold.} Prove your answer.
\end{enumerate}
