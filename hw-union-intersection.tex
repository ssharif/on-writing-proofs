    \item Suppose $A$ is a set. Compute the following. You don't have to prove your answers.

  \end{enumerate}

    \item Suppose $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{2, 3\}$. Write out the following sets in list form. You don't have to prove your answers.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item $((A \cup B) \cup B) \cup B$

    \item Graph the following subsets of $\R^2$. You don't have to prove your answers.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\R \times \{1, 2\}$ \marginnote{If you're confused, write out a few elements of each set.}
      \item $\R \times \Z$
      \item $\Z \times \R$
      \item $[1,2] \times [-1,1]$ (This is interval notation.)
      \item $[1,2]^2$
      \item $\{1,2\}^2$
      \item $[1,2] \times \R$
      \item $\Z \times \{-1, 1\}$
      \item $\Z \times (-1,1)$

    \item Graph the following subsets of $\R^2$. You don't have to prove your answers.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\{(x, y) \mid y - x^2 = 0\}$

    \item Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be as in \Cref{ex:filled-smile}. Graph the following. You do not need to prove your answers.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item $(A \cup B) \cap C$.
      \item $(A \cap B) \cup C$.
      \item $(A \cup C) \cap B$.
      \item $(A \cap C) \cup B$.
  \end{enumerate}

    \item Suppose $A$ and $B$ are finite sets with $\# A = m$ and $\# B = n$.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item What is $\# (A \times B)$?
      \item Suppose $r \in \N$. What is $\# (B^r)$?
  \end{enumerate}

    \item Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are finite sets.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Show by example that $\# (A \cup B)$ does not necessarily equal $\# A + \# B$.
      \item Suppose $\# (A \cup B) = \# A + \# B$. What can you conclude?
  \end{enumerate}

    \item Suppose $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Prove that $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$.\marginnote{This property is of course called \emph{associativity}. When an operation is associative, we can remove the parentheses entirely; e.g.~$A \cup B \cup C$.}
      \item Prove that $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$.
  \end{enumerate}

    \item If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets, prove the following.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) = A \cap (B \cup C)$.
      \item $(A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) = A \cup (B \cap C)$.
  \end{enumerate}

    \item Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. Prove that $A \cap B \subset A \cup B$.

    \item Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets, and that $A \subset A \cap B$. What can you conclude?\sidenote{If you're thinking, ``How the heck should I know?'', then I highly recommend doing out several examples. That is, choose different pairs of sets $A$ and $B$, and test to see if $A \subset A \cap B$ holds or not. Then try to see if there is a pattern to the cases where equality does hold. Remember: you are expected to prove your answer unless explicitly stated otherwise.}
